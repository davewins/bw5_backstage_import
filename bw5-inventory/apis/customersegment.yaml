         ICC: Kumaravel Narayanan 21/08/2008

         ICC: Kumaravel Narayanan 03/09/2008
            (1) Added CONSUMERSME for backward compatibility. This should not be used by new projects        
                Developers should not use CONSUMERSME field to make any decision.
         ICC: Kumaravel Narayanan 22/06/2009
            (1) Removed MVNO from Customer Segment as MVNO can be Prepay as well as Postpay. 
                This change was introduced part of Mobile Change Notification (MDN). 
                Vinod Thomas confirmed that MVNO value is not used in any other service except GetCustomerSegment which has been already modified by MDN project
